### **Project Synopsis: Control Chart System with FastAPI and NiceGUI**

The **Control Chart System** is a robust software solution designed to manage and analyze measurement data for quality control purposes. The system will use **FastAPI** for the backend, **NiceGUI** for the frontend, and **PostgreSQL** for the database. The primary goal is to provide a scalable, user-friendly platform for visualizing control charts, recalculating statistical baselines, and managing measurement data through a seamless, integrated interface.

The backend will handle all data processing, validation, and API endpoints, while the frontend, built with **NiceGUI**, will provide a simple, Python-based UI framework for rapid development and integration. The database will store measurement data, scales, and baselines. The system will also include features for authentication, performance optimization, and thorough testing to ensure reliability.

### **Key Features**
1. **Backend (FastAPI)**:
   - API endpoints for fetching measurements, recalculating statistical baselines, and saving new baselines.
   - Data validation and serialization using **Pydantic**.
   - Database interaction using **SQLAlchemy**.
   - Modular architecture for scalability and maintainability.
   - Authentication and authorization (optional).

2. **Frontend (NiceGUI)**:
   - Python-based UI for filtering data and visualizing control charts.
   - Interactive components for user input (e.g., date pickers, dropdowns).
   - Real-time updates and seamless integration with backend APIs.

3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**:
   - Schema design optimized for performance and scalability.
   - Storage for measurement data, scales, and baselines.

4. **Control Chart Visualization**:
   - Dynamic chart generation using **NiceGUI**'s built-in charting tools or server-side libraries like **Matplotlib** or **Plotly**.

5. **Testing and Performance**:
   - Unit and integration tests for backend and frontend.
   - Performance testing for scalability.

### **Deliverables**

#### **1. Backend (FastAPI)**
- **Project Setup**:
  - Modular project structure.
  - Dependency management with `requirements.txt`.

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /measurements`: Fetch measurement data based on filters (scale ID, date range).
  - `POST /recalculate`: Calculate mean and sigma for a given scale and date range.
  - `POST /save-baseline`: Update baseline mean and sigma for a scale.

- **Database Integration**:
  - SQLAlchemy models for `measurements` and `scales` tables.
  - Database connection and session management.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Graceful handling of missing data, invalid inputs, and database errors.

- **Authentication (Optional)**:
  - Basic token-based authentication for API endpoints.

- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests for all API endpoints.
  - Integration tests for database interactions.

---

#### **2. Frontend (NiceGUI)**
- **Project Setup**:
  - NiceGUI project with a modular structure.
  - Integration with backend APIs.

- **UI Components**:
  - **Filters**: Date pickers, dropdowns for Scale ID, Workstation ID, and Technician ID.
  - **Control Chart Visualization**: Interactive charts using NiceGUI's charting tools or server-side libraries.

- **Validation and Error Handling**:
  - Client-side validation for user inputs.
  - User-friendly error messages for invalid data or server errors.

- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests for UI components.
  - Integration tests for API interactions.

---

#### **3. Database (PostgreSQL)**
- **Schema Design**:
  - `measurements` table with fields: ID, Scale ID, Workstation ID, Technician ID, Measurement Value, Measurement Date.
  - `scales` table with fields: ID, Name, Baseline Mean, Baseline Sigma.

- **Sample Data**:
  - Populate the database with realistic sample data for testing and development.

- **Optimization**:
  - Indexing for frequently queried fields (e.g., Scale ID, Measurement Date).

---

#### **4. Control Chart Visualization**
- **Frontend Charts**:
  - Dynamic and interactive charts for visualizing measurement data using NiceGUI's charting tools.
  - Integration with filters for real-time updates.

- **Server-Side Chart Generation (Optional)**:
  - Generate charts using **Matplotlib** or **Plotly** for PDF reports or static images.

---

#### **5. Testing**
- **Backend**:
  - Unit tests for API endpoints and database interactions.
  - Integration tests for end-to-end functionality.

- **Frontend**:
  - Unit tests for UI components.
  - Usability testing for the control chart interface.

- **Performance**:
  - Load testing for backend APIs.
  - Stress testing for frontend responsiveness.

---

#### **6. Documentation**
- **Technical Documentation**:
  - API documentation using FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI support.
  - Code comments and developer guides.

- **User Documentation**:
  - User manual for the frontend interface.
  - Instructions for setting up and running the system.
